/**
 * Promises in JavaScript provide a way to handle asynchronous operations more effectively and
 *  avoid callback hell.A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an
 *  asynchronous operation.It is in one of three states:
 * Pending: The initial state; the promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected.
 * Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.
 * Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure.
