/**
 * Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
 *   A programming language can be called object-oriented if it
 *   provides four basic capabillities to developers.
 * 1. Encapsulation: The capability to store related information, whether data
 *      or methods, together in object.
 * 2. Aggregation: The capability to store one object inside another object.
 * 3. Inheritance: The capability of a class to rely upon another class (or
 *      number of classes) for some of it properties and methods.
 * 4. Polymorphism: The capability to write one function or method that works
 *      in a variety of different ways.
 * | Syntax for adding a property to an object |
 * --------------------------------------------
 *    objectName.objectProperty = propertyValue;
 * Note:: The "new" operator is used to create an instance of an object.
 *        Followed by the constructor method.
 */

// EXAMPLE 1
var book = new Object();
book.subject = "Perl";
book.author = "Miracle";

/**
 *  EXAMPLE 2
 * Demostrate how to create an object with a User-defined function.
 * Here the "this" keyword is used to refer to object that has been
 * passed to a function.
